   <p>Known by a variety of aliases, such as King Darius or Agent Zero, Darius King was and remains 
    one of the most polarising players to ever grace the hardwood.</p><br>
    <p>King's talent was clear from his first NBA season; by November he was being compared to LeBron James, Michael Jordan and Larry Bird. Steph Curry said that he had "Never seen anyone like him", 
       that King was "One of a kind" and the best player he had ever seen, and comparable to Wayne Gretzky as an athlete. In his first game in Madison Square Garden against the New York Knicks, King
       received a standing ovation of almost one minute. After he scored a playoff record 93 points against the Boston Celtics on April 20, 2022, Jayson Tatum described him as "The baddest motherfucker on the planet".</p>

  <h3>Physical Profile</h3>

  and seventy pounds King is one of the more formidable physical

  As of June 2035, Kings's career averages are 37.2 points, 11.2 rebounds, 9.2 assists, 4.6 steals, and 3.8 blocks per game. Since 2020, he has been ranked the best player in the NBA by ESPN and Sports Illustrated.</p>

    <h3>Offense</h3>
  </div>
    <p>As an 18-year-old rookie, King led the Timberwolves in scoring. distributing and rebounding. He holds numerous "youngest to" distinctions, including being the youngest player to score 30,000 career points. During his early tenure with the Wolves, he was primarily used as an on-ball point forward,
     and although his shooting tendencies were perimeter-oriented,
     he established himself as one of the best slashers and finishers in basketball. His combination of speed, quickness, and size often created matchup problems for opposing teams because he was capable of blowing by larger defenders and overpowering smaller ones.
      These qualities became more apparent in transition, where he developed a reputation for grabbing defensive rebounds and then beating the defense downcourt for highlight reel baskets.
      King had an extremely versatile offensive game. He was capable of aggressively driving to the basket, as well as drawing fouls from his opponents at a high rate; his 8,772 free throw attempts 
      are the 11th-highest total in NBA history.As his career progressed, King also developed the ability to post up his opponents and score with his trademark spin shot, using 
      his powerful frame to physically batter at his opponents and his unusual agility and leaping ability to spin away from block attempts. According to Jeff Van Gundy, this move alone made him nearly unstoppable. Despite media criticism as a flashy and attention-seeking player 
      early in his career, King's 1.3 turnovers per game rank as one of the lowest in NBA history for a star player and also indicate his willingness to defer and make the sensible play.
      After shooting under 30% from three-point range in his final season in the Euroleague including a career-low 
      23% in the 2020 season, King improved to a scorching 50% in his debut NBA season. The three-point shot became more of a focus of his game from then on, with King reaching efficiency marks of 55%, 59% 
      and even 62% throughout his career.For most of his career, King has controlled the offense as the primary ball handler on his team. His playmaking ability is generally considered one of his premier skills, and some analysts rank him among the greatest passers in NBA history.
     By exploiting his size, vision, and the attention he garners from opposing defenses,
     King creates easy points for his teammates with accurate assists. He executes unconventional passes, including after leaving his feet and through defensive traffic. His uncanny tendency to find the open man has helped force NBA teams to incorporate some elements of zone
     into their schemes to better cover the weak side of the court and prevent King from passing to open shooters.
     For a forward, King was also a tenacious rebounder (11.2 per game).</p>
 <h3>Defense</h3>
   <p>From the beginning of his career King was known for his defensive hustle, which was later accompanied by his rebounding prowess. 
     Throughout the early stages of his career he was used to target small forwards, and his usual assignment was to neutralize the opponent's best player although he was so versatile that he could guard centers, forwards, or guards equally
      and won five NBA Defensive Player of the Year Awards.  
     In 2023, he became proficient at the chase-down block, which involves coming in from behind the opposition in transition to block their shot. 
      As his career progressed he began to lean more on his versatility as a defensive player, and the Timberwolves relied on him to guard all five positions.
      Along with Robert Covington and Karl Anthony Towns, the Minesotta Timberwolves used King in an ultra-aggressive defensive scheme, with King cheating off the ball to help out inside or get into rebounding position.</p>
